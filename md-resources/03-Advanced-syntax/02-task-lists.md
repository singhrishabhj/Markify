# Task Lists in Markdown

Task lists are used to create checklists or to-do lists within Markdown documents. They are useful for tracking progress or managing tasks.

## Syntax for Task Lists

To create a task list, use dashes (`-`) or asterisks (`*`) followed by a space and then the task status. Use square brackets (`[ ]`) for an incomplete task and square brackets with an "x" (`[x]`) for a completed task.

### Basic Syntax

- **Incomplete Task**: `[ ] Task`
- **Completed Task**: `[x] Task`

### Example

```markdown
- [ ] Task 1
- [x] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3
```

This will render as:

- [ ] Task 1
- [x] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3

## Nested Task Lists

You can also create nested task lists to represent subtasks:

### Syntax

```markdown
- [ ] Main Task
  - [ ] Subtask 1
  - [x] Subtask 2
```

### Example

```markdown
- [ ] Complete Project
  - [ ] Gather Requirements
  - [x] Design Prototype
  - [ ] Review and Finalize
```

This will render as:

- [ ] Complete Project
  - [ ] Gather Requirements
  - [x] Design Prototype
  - [ ] Review and Finalize

## Usage Tips

- **Track Progress**: Use task lists to track the progress of tasks or to manage project workflows.
- **Nested Tasks**: Employ nested tasks to break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks.
- **Checklists**: Create checklists for personal or team use to ensure all tasks are completed.

Task lists provide a clear and organized way to manage and track tasks directly within your Markdown documents.
