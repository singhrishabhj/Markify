# Introduction to Markdown

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language designed to format plain text in a way that can be easily converted into HTML or other formats. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown aims to be simple and readable, allowing users to write formatted text without needing complex syntax.

## History
