# Lists in Markdown

Lists are used to organize items in a structured format. Markdown supports both unordered and ordered lists.

## Unordered Lists

Unordered lists are used for items that do not require a specific order. They are created using asterisks (`*`), plus signs (`+`), or hyphens (`-`).

### Syntax

- Using asterisks:

  ```markdown
  * Item 1
  * Item 2
    * Subitem 1
    * Subitem 2
  ```

- Using plus signs:

  ```markdown
  + Item 1
  + Item 2
    + Subitem 1
    + Subitem 2
  ```

- Using hyphens:

  ```markdown
  - Item 1
  - Item 2
    - Subitem 1
    - Subitem 2
  ```

### Example

```markdown
* Fruits
  * Apple
  * Banana
  * Orange
```

## Ordered Lists

Ordered lists are used for items that need to be in a specific sequence. They are created by numbering each item.

### Syntax

```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
   1. Subitem 1
   2. Subitem 2
3. Third item
```

### Example

```markdown
1. Plan the project
2. Gather resources
3. Execute the plan
```

## Usage Tips

- **Unordered Lists**: Best for lists where the order of items is not important.
- **Ordered Lists**: Ideal for lists where sequence matters or steps need to be followed.

Using lists helps in organizing information clearly and making documents easier to follow.
