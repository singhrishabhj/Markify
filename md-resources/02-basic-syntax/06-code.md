# Code in Markdown

Markdown supports the inclusion of both inline code and code blocks, making it easy to display code snippets and examples.

## Inline Code
- Inline code refers to small snippets of code or commands that are embedded within a line of regular text. It is used to highlight or differentiate short pieces of code without breaking the flow of the surrounding content. Inline code is typically used for commands, variable names, or short code segments.

- To include a short piece of code within a line of text, use single backticks (\`):

### Syntax

```markdown
`inline code`
```

### Example

```markdown
Use the `print()` function to display output.
```

This will render as: Use the `print()` function to display output.

## Code Blocks

For longer code snippets or blocks of code, use triple backticks (\`\`\`) or indent with four spaces:

### Syntax with Triple Backticks

```markdown
```
Your code here
```
```

### Example

```markdown
```
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```
```

### Syntax with Indentation

```markdown
    def hello_world():
        print("Hello, world!")
```

### Example

```markdown
    def hello_world():
        print("Hello, world!")
```

## Syntax Highlighting

To specify the language for syntax highlighting, add the language name right after the opening triple backticks:

### Syntax

```markdown
```language
Your code here
```
```

### Example for Python

```markdown
```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```
```

## Usage Tips

- **Inline Code**: Use for short code snippets or commands within text.
- **Code Blocks**: Use for larger pieces of code, examples, or configuration files.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Specify the language to improve readability and highlighting.

Including code in Markdown helps in sharing code examples, configurations, and making technical documentation clearer.
