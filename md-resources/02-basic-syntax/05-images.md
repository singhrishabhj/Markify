# Images in Markdown

Images can be embedded in Markdown documents to add visual elements. Markdown makes it easy to include images using a straightforward syntax.

## Syntax for Images

To include an image, use the following syntax:

```markdown
![Alt Text](URL)
```

- **`![Alt Text]`**: The alt text (alternative text) that describes the image. This is important for accessibility and SEO.
- **`(URL)`**: The path to the image file or the image URL.

### Example

```markdown
![Sample Image](https://www.example.com/image.jpg)
```

This will display an image from the provided URL.

## Optional: Adding Titles

You can also add a title attribute that appears as a tooltip when the user hovers over the image:

```markdown
![Alt Text](URL "Title Text")
```

### Example with Title

```markdown
![Sample Image](https://www.example.com/image.jpg "This is a sample image")
```

## Linking Images

To make an image a clickable link, you can combine the image syntax with link syntax:

```markdown
[![Alt Text](URL)](Link URL)
```

### Example

```markdown
[![Sample Image](https://www.example.com/image.jpg)](https://www.example.com)
```

## Usage Tips

- **Alt Text**: Always provide descriptive alt text for images to improve accessibility.
- **Image Size**: Ensure images are optimized for the web to avoid long loading times.
- **Links**: Use image links to make images clickable if needed.

Including images in your Markdown documents helps make content more engaging and informative.
