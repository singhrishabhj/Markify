# Links in Markdown

Links are used to create hyperlinks to external websites or internal documents. Markdown makes it simple to include clickable links in your content.

## Syntax for Links

### Basic Links

To create a hyperlink, use the following syntax:

```markdown
[Link Text](URL)
```

- **`[Link Text]`**: The text that will be clickable.
- **`(URL)`**: The web address or destination of the link.

### Example

```markdown
[XYZzy](https://www.xyzzy.com)
```

This will appear as: [XYZzy](https://www.xyzzy.com)

### Links with Titles

You can also add a title attribute that appears when the user hovers over the link:

```markdown
[Link Text](URL "Title Text")
```

### Example with Title

```markdown
[Example](https://www.Example.com "Visit Example's website")
```

This will appear as: [Example](https://www.Example.com "Visit Example's website")

## Linking to Internal Documents

To link to other documents within the same repository or project, use the relative path to the file:

```markdown
[Document Title](path/to/document.md)
```

### Example

```markdown
[Markdown Guide](docs/markdown-guide.md)
```

## Usage Tips

- **Descriptive Text**: Use descriptive text for links to provide context about what the link is for.
- **Titles**: Adding a title can give users additional information about the link destination.

Links are essential for providing additional resources, references, and navigation within your content.
