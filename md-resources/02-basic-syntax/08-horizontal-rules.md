# Horizontal Rules in Markdown

Horizontal rules are used to create a visual separation between sections of content. They help to break up text and improve the readability of your document.

## Syntax for Horizontal Rules

To insert a horizontal rule, use three or more dashes (`---`), asterisks (`***`), or underscores (`___`). Make sure to use them on a new line with no other text on that line.

### Using Dashes

```markdown
---
```

### Using Asterisks

```markdown
***
```

### Using Underscores

```markdown
___
```

### Example

```markdown
Section 1

---

Section 2
```

This will render as:

---

Section 1

---

Section 2

## Usage Tips

- **Section Dividers**: Use horizontal rules to separate different sections or topics within your document.
- **Visual Breaks**: Employ horizontal rules to provide visual breaks in long documents, improving readability.
- **Consistency**: Choose one style (dashes, asterisks, or underscores) and use it consistently throughout your document for uniformity.

Horizontal rules help in organizing content and providing a clear visual structure in your Markdown documents.
